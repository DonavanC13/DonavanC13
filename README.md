- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DonavanC13
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software and web development 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, and just a little bit of python in my spare time
- âš¡ Fun fact: The Aegis Combat System is the Navyâ€™s most modern surface combat system.
- It was designed as a complete system: the missile launching element,
- the computer programs, the radar and the displays are fully integrated to work together.
- This makes the Aegis system the first fully integrated combat system built to defend against advanced air and surface threats.
